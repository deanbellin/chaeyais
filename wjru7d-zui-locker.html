                            <p> So "ok google" always turned my phone on and would work even when it was sleeping and idle. I installed ZUI locker and I cant figure out how to get "ok google" to keep working when the phone is sleeping ZUI Locker pushed out an update that adds a new lockscreen on top of the one you already have, that only comes up when charging. It looks entirely different, has no indication that it's from ZUI Locker. After googling around, I'd found other cases of this happening with non-lockscreen apps, so I figured I installed some dumb shit that was screwing up my great lockscreen. Not the case, they screwed it up themselves. Luckily, it can be turned off. Here's a review I wrote Hi folks, I'm using the lockscreen "ZUI" for my new One Plus 3T. Unfortunately, I can't figure how to enable the fingerprint access ? Could you help me ? Thanks. I used to use ZUI locker and I loved the daily lock screen wallpaper. It seems so much more intuitive than a daily home screen wallpaper since not all wallpapers are going to look good with the icon layout I usually use Zui Locker and I have biometrics enabled. It causes me to have to double unlock my phone - once with the intelligent scan, then I have to swipe to unlock the zui locker. On my s7, I would just disable the lock screen security, but with the s9 it delete's my fingerprints - which lastpass uses. Any ideas? Maybe there's a way to have the samsung lockscreen wallpapers change with ifttt or something. 
Greetings. I'm currently using ZUI Locker and Quickpic for my lock and gallery respectively, but they've drawn some issues that I'm getting fed up with. ZUI Locker's only real problem seems to be battery hogging. Phone constantly tells me it's using too much power and I just don't like the stats from battery usage indicators. I know there are a million lockers out there, most or which do the same thing but I have two requirements from my lock app. - The ability to choose from a folder Hello, I really want to use this image (https://imgur.com/a/Eo9uW) as my lock screen wallpaper, but it make it really hard to see the clock because it's written in white and has very thin and transparent shadow. Is there anyway around this please ? IMPORTANT!! : Almost every google search i did resulted in people giving tips on how to change the Always On Screen clock, i am NOT talking about that, i am talking about the Lock Screen wallpaper and its clock. Thank If your lock screen app freezes, a pop up will say "This app is not responding, close" and if the person who stole your phone presses OK, the lockscreen app closes and they can access your phone. This has been the case with every single third-party lockscreen I have used, including zui-locker. Hello, Is there a way to get Lockscreen notifications for WhatsApp like on iOS? So the whole message is always shown and not only the amount of messages received if you receive multiple ones from one contact. I tried a few Lockscreen-Replacements but most of them didn't work or didn't have fingerprint support. ampnbsp; ampnbsp; I already tried the following replacements: ampnbsp; + CMLocker (got everything but CheetahMobile is not very trusted.) + SlideLock. Does anyone know a 3rd party lockscreen app that allows my Z2, or any other Xperia, to open the camera app with a long press of the dedicated camera button? In the past I've have tried all "popular" lockscreen apps like Go Locker, Next Lock Screen, ZUI Locker, Echo. and about 20 more. Finally I just gave up and settled for the stock Sony lockscreen which I don't like, but I prefer functionality above looks. But after 3 years I want some freaking good looks to (for my phone). Custom lockscreen that shows music currently being played. I like Zui Locker, no doubts but the last time I installed it (about 3 months or so), it eats too much battery. Thanks for the suggestions. Hello! I've been wondering if its normal for my phone to have a really silent static sound when using an earphones and Im using a Blu Vivo 5. The static sound can only be heard when I use anything that uses sounds (video, music, notification) and i mostly hear it after the sound is finish. And yes I already push the earphones all the way in (And yes I already tested it with 4 different earphones and all have the buzz/static. My stock blu earphone is broken but when I use that earphone the buzz/. 
I've had zui locker for a while now because that was the best I could find at the time. Now I need something better. I just want a lock screen that lets me choose my pictures and doesn't have any stupid long press actions because of pocket/butt dials. Weather information on the lockscreen would be damn nice too. I'm willing to pay up to  (Google rewards). The reason I want to switch is because zui locker gives me free pictures when I don't want any. Because of this, almost everyday When I wake up every morning to my alarm, I would like to be able to bypass my lock screen (ZUI locker) and just turn off my alarm (Timely) as soon as i'm on the phone. Seems too clunky to swipe on the lock screen, enter the password and first then be able to turn off the alarm. I've been trying a little myself, but I'm so new to Tasker, that I don't know where to begin. Help appreciated. Since the beginning of me having an android phone I tried using a lock screen app because the stock ones were freaking ugly. I've tried every single one that's out there. None of 'em were capable of staying activated for longer than a day. This is basically the problem: I install a lock screen app. I'm currently on ZUI Locker. The app adds it's own ON/OFF button to my accessibility options. I turn the button ON. After around a day I notice my lock screen is disabled I check the button. 
Hey, I'm a French user, speaking English fluently but sometimes I get lost by the English UI, and not to mention other French people that can't speak English as well as that. that's why I'm asking to translate the app to french. I could do it for free, just leave my name in the credits. If you're not convinced, be sure to know I translated two apps (ImageShrink, ZUI locker) and a video game (Super Mario Star Road). Just tell me how to do, send me the files and it will be a pleasure I often find myself listening to music and podcasts in the car, but most lock screen controls for phones are small, off-center buttons in the lock screen player notification. Does anyone know of an app that makes the controls more like Apple devices, with the play/pause, forward, and back buttons centered and easily clickable without looking? The closest I've found to this is ZUI Locker, which puts the controls at the bottom of the screen. I would prefer if it was a solution that could I wanted to have a lock screen background that would be different from my homescreen's, so I looked up lock screen apps, and found PIP Lock Screen and ZUI Locker. Tried them both but decided I wanted my stock lock screen back because the twist camera gesture would lose its purpose as I'd have to input my pattern everytime before accessing the camera. So I disabled them and went to the settings to set my stock pattern back again, only to find out that it no longer works, the phone I recently tried out a few lockscreens like Google Next, Hi locker and currently using ZUI locker and for some reason it doesn't always work with my fingerprint, sometimes it immediately picks it up, and sometimes it feels like its "disables" because i just cant open it with my fingerprint. it happened pretty much in all lockscreens. I have been trying to find a better lockscreen for my G4. I have used countless lockers; all have had an issue. Customizability, looks, and effectiveness all mean a lot to me when it comes to my lockscreen. Here is what I like about some lockscreens: -Being able to change how the clocks look. -Having a way to adjust my brightness/volume from lockscreen -Being able to match my launcher wallpaper to my lock screen wallpaper Here is what I didn't like about them: -Ads pop up as notifications.

I want one that supports music controls and maybe Chromecast (not sure if that's the same as the music controls) I was looking at Hi Locker and Zui Locker but I was wondering if anyone has tried those or recommend any other.
