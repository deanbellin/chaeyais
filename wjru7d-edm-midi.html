Download EDM MIDI Melodies Vol. 2 by The Audio Bar on Beatport Sounds. Hey I'm a long time musician, and I've been using Reaper to lay down backing tracks for a while. I just recently started getting into the world of midi and making electronic music with it. In my never-ending YouTube video watching spree, I've come to find that all the tutorials are in FL studio, Ableton, or Logic. I'm wondering why there are very few people doing this stuff in Reaper. Kenny Gioia is my go-to guy, but aside from him, there's hardly anyone else on the writing EDM in Reaper.

So everywhere i look, i see people telling other people (online) to avoid Studio 1 for making any type of electronic dance music. They say oooh no for EDM you need FL or Ableton or even Bitwig. Whats funny is a lot of professional producers use Cubase/Logic which to me is a lot more similar to Studio 1. Now why do you guys think people feel that making dance music in studio one is really difficult, more time intensive, less intuitive etc? I really dont get this. Studio 1 has so many things. "Progressive & EDM Midi" delivers 50 fresh EDM MIDI progressions, to be used in your next tracks instantly. Having hard times constructing your next unique melody? This pack is here to help you fasten the creation process and unleash the inspiration. Everyone I talk to about reaper makes anything but edm. How good is it for edm compared to ableton, for example. Are there any templates or stuff I can check out? There are only old projects on their site. If anyone produces edm and would be kind enough to send me a template, it would be much appreciated. BTW I am not new to DAWs, just trying out reaper. 
Download EDM MIDI Vol 7 by Shockwave on Beatport Sounds. I have both Korg Volca Sample and Akai Mpk, is it possible to make techno or house music live just with these? Because it feels like the korg volca sample is limited and just keeps looping.also, I see a lot of Ableton Tutorials about making techno but it's about making your own track and not jamming live. Are there any tutorials about jamming live? Or does making edm live require hardware gears and not possible with software.
