                            <p>Hi! So I recently built a PC, and now I'm searching for options to keep virus and malware out of it. I know that you should have one 24/7 antivirus, and one on-demand anti-malware, but now i'm looking for a good combination. I dont mind paying, so dont be afraid to recommend paid options. I have read a lot on Malwarebytes, and it seems like quite a good option. But I'm a bit confused on the different options for Malwarebytes. You can either have it Free, which mean no 24/7 scan (just. I just turned off anti malware malwarebytes as it was crashing my game constantly and now it works. 
#Guide to Setting up Windows 10 Windows Installation: Download Windows Media Creation Tool (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10). Create a USB installation drive using Was really craving some Skyrim, so I decided to make the leap from LE to SE and start fresh. Downloaded and installed all the latest software and was starting to get a modlist going when MO2 crashed and my anti-malware (Malwarebytes) detected Ransomware in the program. It's since quarantined it, and I'm unable to open, move, or delete the .exe. Has anyone experienced this before? I'd like to get back into modding but I want to make sure I'm using a trustworthy program (I don't https://i.redd.it/w0gxkxqcf1s01.png Malwarebytes installation instructions, Malwarebytes installation help, Malwarebytes installation guide, Malwarebytes installation, \+1\-855\-550\-9333 , Malwarebytes free downloads, Malwarebytes downloads, Malwarebytes download, Malwarebytes Anti\-Malware ( \+1\-855\-550\-9333 , Install Malwarebytes, Download Malwarebytes, Malwarebytes configuration support number, Malwarebytes troubleshooting support number,\+1\-8. I recently did up an article relating to the security of most computers systems in networks and had contacted /u/pedro19 (founder of PCMR subreddit and other) about having it stickied. Now my last post was in shambles to say the least given I was not of the best state of mind at the time so I am redoing it to a much better extent. Ok getting down to the brass tacks, I am a very seasoned computer security consultant/penetration tester (I am a hacker for hire more or less) and I have noticed Hey everyone! First want to say a huge thank you to the community! Two weeks ago at this time, I was TERRIFIED of the idea of building a PC, thought it was impossible and way too complicated. Thanks to your help, the wiki, and the community, last night I've fully ascended (well I'd say 90% there)! My PC is up and running (Windows 10 Pro) and have already installed my Steam Library. So you're probably asking, "Doesn't that mean you're at 100%?". First of all These are my PC Specs : -Windows 10 -GTX970 Windforce X3 OC (Gigabyte) -AMD Fx8350 with CoolerMaster Evo 212 -8gb DDR3 1600mhz Cl11 -WD Blue 500gb 16mb cache 7200 rpm HDD -SSD kingston 60gb -Mobo GIGABYTE GA-970-Gaming -ThermalTake Smart SE 630w The PC restarts after like 1 minute in Furmark and after 10 minutes or less of gaming (Overwatch all low settings, Warframe, Endless Legend). Event viewer gives kernel power event ID 41 error . I have tried with a different 
I downloaded Youtube videos, but found out just now it is illegal. I thought that if Mozilla page has add-on for that, it must be legal! Could Youtube videos be infected? Could Youtube infect them to punish illegal downloading? I removed the add-on - should I delete those videos too to be safe? If I use AVAST, Emsisoft Anti-Malware, Malwarebytes and SuperAntispyware Free Edition, will I be safe and find anything there is? I'll never download anything from Youtube ever again. Now, I have had these problems on and off, the double-click I got rid of, it is not a hardware, it is some software issue, it was in the past ad.double-click.net, I have tried everything even in the guide and NOTHING showed up. I use windows 10 as well. I have McAfee (not a fan but my friends it dad recommends it atm for free since all the ones I have read about in my mags are rated actually really low) Anti Malware Malwarebytes Roguekiller Spybot S&D CCleaner I even did a 7 hour 35 minute. Windows 10 Every ~20 minutes, whatever window I'm using "unselects" as if I clicked away to something else (the window remains). From what I've seen online, this may be symptom of a background program attempting to "pull my attention away" to a different application. I have little to zero computer knowledge, and when scrolling through my Task Manager, all things look foreign to me, and thus I can't tell if one shouldn't be there. I feel like I first noticed this after accidentally visiting. The title says it all, I'm feelling my pc slower than normal and I think I might have something consuming my RAM and my current Anti-malware (Malwarebytes) isnt working, probably because of the virus I might have, so I need a new one and I'm looking for sugestions. Cheers PS: This might not be the place, if so I'm sorry 
Hello all I am kinda noob in computer, and i jsut bought a enw laptop to work with, im not sure its the good section either.sorry I jsut wanted to know what security do I need?! I have some personnal date of clients in my laptop so i want ot amke sure i am well protected! I google a bit, and i found I need a -Firewall (windows 8 defualt firewall) -antivirus (avg) -anti malware (malwarebytes) is thsi all I need?! can oyu guys suggestion a combination of programm i can isntall If you follow the competitive scene in heroes, we've seen what appears to be some DDOS against Equinox in regional qualifiers. This is also becoming more common across the online competitive games. Based on this happening, I decided to try and help with the following information. However, there seems to be a big gap in those who say ddos versus what a ddos actually is. DDOS has become something people say on a whim when they don't know what it is, how it works, or if it is truely the problem. I was just wondering if my computer was secure enough since this is my first time going with a free antivirus and free security software. I've usually paid for my pc security with antiviruses like Bitdefender and Kaspersky. The current programs I'm using for my free pc security are: Avira, Malwarebytes Anti-Malware, Malwarebytes Anti-Exploit, SuperAntiSpyware, and ZoneAlarm for my firewall. Are there any programs I need to install for better pc security? Or, have I installed too many? Should. My "System" process is currently at 5 391 268 K ram usage. Anyone have any clues? I've scanned with Kaspersky, Malwarebytes anti-malware, Malwarebytes anti-rootkit. Nothing found as of yet. If its hardware its probably my hdd as it is quite old. But I don't see how it could cause problems unless it is causing memory leaks due to issues with the driver or something. edit: This is an infection I came across last week on a workstation of a brand new client. It seems to effect Explorer.exe. At first, it's completely unusable, crashing as soon as it's opened, even in safe mode. I was able to get a couple of utilities to run, making Explorer stable enough to use once, before it locks up. The PC seems to work fine until you open a folder. Once a folder is open, everything turns to hell. The taskbar, start menu, right click, and folders all cease to work.When you click. 
Basically got 4 levels of protection on my sandbox machine (OpenDNS Umbrella, ESET Smart Security, Malwarebytes Anti-Malware, Malwarebytes Anti-Exploit), still didn't get caught/was able to browse all the way to the PDF File CLICK AT YOUR OWN RISK!! I'm just posting it in here in case someone smarter than me would like to do further analysis on it Subject of the email was "check this". Body of the email wants you to check out a "google document" here: http://www.wedolights4u.com/lights_fil. We're aware of Ninite, but we feel we should have a thread on the BEST software. This will be a frequently updated guide on the best software to use for each category listed. If you feel a program should be up for consideration, POST IT IN THE COMMENTS with a link to the download and what category it is in. POST SUGGESTIONS AND UPVOTE SUGGESTIONS, ADD CATEGORIES OR SOFTWARE TO THE LIST BY POSTING IN COMMENTS. The devices relevant for my problem are: My Samsung Android Tablet (TE-something I think?), acquired last summer and My 6 years old desktop PC, GIGABYTE motherboard, Windows 7 32bit, 4GB RAM, some old AMD CPU This whole mess started last October on my tablet, which I had only gotten some weeks or maybe a month prior. I was browsing one of my most visited and trusted sites (a forum for fans of the Civilization game franchise), when suddenly a bazillion gazillion ads popped up, as obnoxious. 
Hi, Firstly, I should point out that I am by no means any sort of computer expert so even though I think I am practicing some pretty safe internet usage there is the possibility I am very wrong. Over the last month or so, I have been having a lot of problems with malware. At first, my laptop's fan starting running at top speed and it sounded like it would take off like a helicopter. I found that there was a bitcoin miner in my system. Removed that and now Malwarebytes keeps finding a trojan. PC Info: Specs here aren't really relevant, running Win7 SP1 So, a few weeks back I was playing around with some old archive for a specific game I was trying to create a private server for and I stupidly clicked a link that a very-quickly realized I shouldn't have. I knew almost immediately that the file I had downloaded (and already unzipped) contained a virus. I panicked a bit, but thought to myself "I've never really encountered a bad virus before, I should be good." So, I hop on Chrome Anti-malware (Malwarebytes) threw a warning/block IP when I accessed the site from a link posted earlier. Just a heads. For some reason Windows Firewall is behaving strangely on my Windows 8.1 (upgraded from Win8) machine. it keeps turning itself off or malfunctioning and taking my internet connectivity with it. Several times a day, I will be browsing in Chrome and all of a sudden notice that pages aren't loading up. In the activity bar at the bottom left it says "Establishing secure connection." and it just stays like that for ages until eventually the page fails to load. I then have to open up services.ms. I get this multiple times a day ( started getting it around 8 or 9 months ago. I have done many anti-malware(malwarebytes) cleans and anti-virus(Microsoft Security Essentials) and both have come up with nothing. Is it actually a Virus/Malware issue or could it be an ISP or internet connection problem? Any help is appreciated. 
Malwarebytes is a light-weight anti-malware program that is excellent at removing the latest detections. MBAM is also able to be used along side any other security.
